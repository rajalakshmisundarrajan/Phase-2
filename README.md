# 🚦 Enhancing Road Safety Using AI-Driven Traffic Accident Analyses and Prediction

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze traffic accident data and predict accident severity. The goal is to improve road safety by identifying key risk factors and providing actionable insights through AI.

---

## 📌 Project Description

Road accidents are a major public safety concern. By analyzing historical accident data using AI models, we can predict the severity of accidents based on environmental and situational factors. This project includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and classification model development.
